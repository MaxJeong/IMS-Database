# IMS-Database

The following are instructions for the database.
===================================

After installing the MYSQL server and have it running.

You want to execute the line 
Create Database C43;

You then will want to run the sql scripts in the 

table/setup.sql

This will create the tables and data, stored procedures, triggers, views.

=================================================

Python

We used version 3.4 with MYSQL connector https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/python/

which you will need to download.

The file you will want to run is terminal.py

=================================================

Php

To set up the copy locally get a webserver going, copy the web folder to the root directory for webserver and done.

There is a configuration in the folder tpl/Config.php

This connects to our mysql server and you can change to your own server.
